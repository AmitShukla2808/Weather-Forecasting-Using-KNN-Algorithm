# Weather-Forecasting-Using-KNN-Algorithm
This repository includes the project of using K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to implement a binary classification problem of predicting rainfall. K Nearest Neighbour is a basic classification algorithm that chooses a class for an example depending upon its proximity to the trained examples. It can prove to be an efficient way of classification problems.
